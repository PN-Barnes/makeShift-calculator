# MakeShift Calculator

## Overview

The MakeShift Calculator 1-day project is my simple reintroductory to coding project. this took me about 4 full focused hours in order to complete, as it was mostly shaking the rust off my brain for functions and logic based coding. Please take a look at my code and tear it apart! Any criticism will be greatly appreciated.

## Why a calculator?

I decided to pick a calculator as I was moving through tutorials as a way for me to move back into coding. However, this was not the right way, as I didnt feel I had the ability to do any coding on my own. I kicked a couple projects back and forth in my mind, but never moved on anything. Now that I feel better about this project, I will definitely try the other projects after feeling better about this one.
